Files involved in preprocessing of the data.  
 * process_sonar.ipynb :
   * creates a usable TXF_df file containing the term trequency scores extracted from the lemma frequencylist,
   * it also outputs a clean corpus file containing the preprocessed frequency list, but still with only the frequencies
   * also outputs zerowords file, where you can see what words were left unrecognized (assigned a score of zero) during the scoring of informativeness
 * preprocess_conditions
  * extracts and formats the relevant measures from the survey output files
